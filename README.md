# Weather-Monitoring-System-using-ESP8266

**Second-year B.Tech project in Computer Science and Engineering (Intelligent Systems) at MIT School of Engineering, MIT ADT University.**

**Abstract:**

Internet of Things (IoT) is an advanced and efficient solution for connecting and exchanging data with other devices over the Internet. As IoT interact and communicate with each other, the human effort that saves time is minimized. IoT technology is used in the framework proposed in this project. This system basically is the solution for monitoring various parameters like heat index, soil moisture, temperature and humidity. Using IoT and respective sensors, the above mentioned parameters are measured. The weather analysis is made available on the desktop through the website. The user will be able to access the updates through the website where he/she can view the information in the form of statistics.

**Software/Hardware Used:**

1. Arduino IDE
2. ThingSpeak
3. ESP8266
4. DHT11 Sensor
5. Soil Moisture Sensor Module
6. Breadboard
